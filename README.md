# jmarnold/feedback

This is a quick little ask-me-anything type of repository. Yes, I stole it from other people.

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/jmarnold/feedback/issues/new) on this
project.

---

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/jmarnold/feedback/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.

### Twitter

If you have something quick and easy, I'm [@jmarnold](https://twitter.com/jmarnold) on
Twitter.
